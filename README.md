This project focuses on creating a machine learning model to determine a candidate's eligibility for loan approval. By analyzing key factors like income, credit history, employment, and loan amount, the model predicts the likelihood of successful repayment.
The system is designed to streamline the loan approval process, providing accurate and fair assessments to minimize financial risks for lenders. It ensures informed decision-making while promoting responsible lending practices.
This project offers an efficient solution for financial institutions to identify eligible candidates and allocate loans effectively.
